# CQFT-DM-SUPPLEMENT

**Supplemental Document to the Article: "The End of the WIMP"**

This repository contains the full methodological and conceptual foundations supporting the key prediction of the Constitutive Quantum Field Theory (CQFT) regarding Dark Matter (DM) direct detection.

## Core Content

This document rigorously validates the two central pillars of the CQFT Dark Matter prediction:

1.  **Emergent Mass ($\mathbf{m_\chi}$):** The mass scale ($\approx 20 \text{ GeV}$) is derived through the **Polaron Analogy**, establishing an isomorphism between the DM quantum ($\chi$) and a dressed quasiparticle in a supersolid, where mass emerges from the elastic rigidity of the Constitutive Vacuum ($K_g$).
2.  **Effective Coupling ($\mathbf{\sigma_{SI}}$):** The specific spin-independent cross-section ($\approx 2.4 \times 10^{-47} \text{ cm}^2$) is derived using the **Path Integral Formalism** and **UV $\to$ IR Matching**. This process shows that the coupling arises from a dimension-6 operator suppressed by the high UV scale, $M_\Psi$. The calculation confirms that the inevitable combination of the operator suppression and the Helm nuclear form factor leads directly to the predicted cross-section.

## Validation Roadmap (2025-2030)

The supplementary material concludes by defining a clear and falsifiable experimental horizon for CQFT, based on three independent windows:

* **Direct Detection:** Target sensitivity for LZ/DARWIN.
* **Indirect Detection:** Quadrupole anisotropy ($\alpha_2$) search in Fermi-LAT data.
* **Latent Component:** RF Haloscope testing at $96.7 \text{ MHz}$.
